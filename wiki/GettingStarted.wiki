== Is sqlmake for you? == 
Sqlmake is a deployment tool for sql scripts with support for Oracle only databases. It is a windows .NET executable so it requires Windows OS and .NET runtime. Oracle client is also required because sqlmake interacts directly with Oracle database.

Sqlmake was created to support easy configuration management of sql scripts with support of automatic deployment of schema (modifications). With sqlmake it is very easy to deploy database schema in a new environment, keep it up to date with new delta scripts and new versions of pl/sql packages.

Following goals were set during implementation of the tool:
  * Database schema is not only about tables and indexes. PL/SQL is vital part of the database development process and must be equally supported.
  * There must be minimal or no extra work for database developer with preparing sql scripts 
  * Existing database modeling tools, pl/sql development tools and other must coexist with sqlmake 

== How it works?==
Sqlmake requires sql scripts to be divided in the following three groups:
  * Optional data model folder where you keep data model baseline scripts
  * Upgrade folder where you keep sql delta scripts for datamodel upgrade
  * Plsql folder where you keep stored procedures, views, etc
SQL scripts content requires no additional choreography, plain old SQL*Plus script syntax is used. Sqlmake ignores all SQL*Plus commands for now.

How sql scripts are organized inside the three groups is up to the user (except for the upgrade delta scripts which must conform to a naming convention). All SQL commands can be in one big sql scripts, every SQL command can be in its own file, subdirectories can be created and so on. This makes it very flexible to compensate output of different data modeling tools generators. 

Delta upgrade scripts have to be named according to following naming convention: "VERSION_CUSTOMNAME.sql".  For example 121_create_table_employees.sql. Version is an incremental numerical number used to determine correct sequence when applying delta scripts.

Much like to the directory structure when you run sqlmake you have an option to:
  * Install baseline sql scripts
  * Upgrade schema with delta sql scripts or 
  * Deploy plsql code
After invocation sqlmake parses sql scripts and executes SQL commands against an Oracle database. No SQL*Plus or other external tool is required. 
  * When installing data model sqlmake automatically parses all scripts to determine the correct order of sql statements. There is no need to separate SQL commands in tables.sql, indexes.sql, constraints.sql and so on.
  * When upgrading data model sqlmake automatically determines current schema version and applies only necessary delta scripts
  * When deploying plsql code sqlmake applies only new, modified or deleted plsql code. It does this by doing a diff between plsql code on filesystem and plsql code in database. If there is no difference nothing is modified in the database schema. 

At the end sqlmake updates schema metadata with current schema version (kept in table SQLMAKE) and reports status info.
== Try it == 
Sqlmake requires Windows, .NET 2.0 (or higher) runtime and an Oracle Client 10g (or higher). To run these examples you need access to an Oracle database. 

*Download distribution package and prepare a new empty oracle schema*

1. From the downloads page download the distribution zip file. 

2. Unzip this in c:\. 

3. Prepare a new oracle user SMDEMO with password SMDEMO 

4. Grant CONNECT and RESOURCE roles to oracle user SMDEMO

=== PART I: Datamodel baseline deployment ===
*Deploy schema to a new clean environment*

5. Open a command prompt cmd.exe in the unziped directory

6. Deploy datamodel baseline (example1)

Sqlmake actions are intentionally kept very atomically. Use NANT to combine them in powerful deployment combination suited to your environment.
